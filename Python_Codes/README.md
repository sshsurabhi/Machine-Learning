# Hello welcome to my Git World

These are the simple python tasks which I solved in hackerrank for a recruitment task. I do not have the questions right now but these codes passed all the testcases to the questions.
I was very happy at that time and I wanted to share this codes because this was my first hackerrank task which I solved ever.

I used normal virtual environment in PyCharm to run this codes. No dependencies are needed to run these codes.

## Thank You.
